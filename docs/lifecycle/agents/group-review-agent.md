# Agent Governance Record — group-review-agent

## Overview

- **Agent Name**: group-review-agent
- **Formal Name**: Group Review Agent
- **Role**: Group-level review lead — portfolio fit, intra-group transaction compliance, capital-allocation ranking across concurrent proposals, and S12 venture portfolio monitoring
- **Phase**: production
- **Domain**: functional / group
- **Tier**: high

## Scope

Group-level review distinct from entity-level review: portfolio fit, intra-group transaction compliance, and capital allocation prioritization across concurrent proposals.

## Phase History

- **2026-08-19**: Initial release. Created during Stage 0.2 (agent roster build-out) per design v1.0 section 5.
- **2026-10-25**: Definition rewritten from stub to the canonical 9-section standard (design 2026-10-25-agent-and-context-ssot-upgrade, v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Legal Basis / Role / Responsibilities / Protocols / Constraints / Meeting Participation / Engagement Context / Deliverable Standards / Special Instructions; frontmatter gains role, color, examples, phases, handoff wiring, required_skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Carries `lifecycle` frontmatter with `phase` and `governance`
- [x] Validated by `scripts/validate-agents.ts`
